                    </span>
                    <p>So it's been a year since i started coding. The ups and downs, lessons learnt and experienced gained
                        is worth mentioning.</p>
                    <p>Before the spark to code was ignited all i ddi was create story maps... some of you know me through story
                        maps. I guess this was a hobby. I called it
                        <em>"Story map of the week"</em>. It seemed to touch the hearts of many including mine. I wont refuse
                        it was very fun and exciting to create this story map collection.</p>
                    <p>Although the feeling of creating a story maps and getting good reviews from others wasn't enough for
                        me. THe need to create something original started to arise. I wanted something of my own. Something
                        i could say i made that works - An app or something.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>The big leap</h2>
                    <p>For some reason I just felt that i needed to get out of the comfort zone and learn some programming.
                        Ofcourse when you are a beginner you dont know which language to learn first. I had to know what
                        i would major in would be web applications.</p>
                    <p>HTML sounded like a giant to me. As soon as i started to learn it i realised that its just a grasshopper
                        and only a drop in the ocean. I learnt HTML and Css basics in one day. Funny when i remember how
                        just the word "HELLO WORLD" made me very happy. I then started creating dummy websites and using
                        bootstrap until i learnt of the existence of templates that come with a complete package and all
                        you have to do is tweak and hack around it to make it yours. Coding was just so fun.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Baby steps</h2>
                    <p>I had started to hear terms such as servers, database, domain, backend, fullstack just to name but a
                        few.
                    </p>
                    <p>I started learning some backend languages eg Python . Thank you DJANGO.I can say this was my first big
                        plunge into web applications. I introduced myself to databases such as
                        <em>postgresql, mongodb, etc</em>. Everything was just going so fast. I had even gained problem solving
                        skills from debugging. I had discovered very useful tools such as
                        <em>Stack Overflow</em> where i could basically just find my solution. Google had now become my best
                        friend, Youtube my favorite uncle and documentations my teacher. </p>

                    <hr class="major" />

                    <h2>Tough times</h2>
                    <p>Hackathons and Bootcamps were pretty scary for me during the first months of attending them. With time
                        this became a thing of the past. I really got to appreciate the power of team work. Some were wins
                        others were not but the point to bring home is that all that matters is having fun. Enjoying what
                        you do.</p>
                    <p>My life has changed in diverse ways ever since i started programming. I spend more hours on my laptop
                        trying to create innovations rather than just watch movies. I am even more confident when it comes
                        to IT. I think more clearly before making decisions.It's January 2018, a year since i started coding
                        and am not stopping. Its been a year of trying out many things... ember,angular,react native,adonis,go,node,mongo...
                        the list goes on. I live to code.</p>
                    <p style="color:darkgreen">Ofcourse Credits go to those who encouraged me and held my hand. Thanks
